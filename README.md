# Water Demand Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

This project was part of my IIT Madras Diploma. The objective was to collaborate with a real business and solve one of its operational problems using data.

For this project, I partnered with a facility management company in our residential society. They shared water consumption data under an NDA agreement. Due to confidentiality, I cannot share the raw data or financial details in this repository. However, the masked (removing sensitive information) project report and code are included to illustrate the approach and methodology.

## üìå Project Overview

The project focused on analyzing residential water consumption patterns and forecasting future demand to:

* Reduce the frequency of water cuts.
* Enable better resource allocation and planning.
* Compare costs across different water sources to optimize spending.

A time series forecasting model was built in **R** to predict water usage and guide resource planning decisions.

## üîç Key Results

* **Reduced Water Cuts**: Forecasting allowed for proactive planning, significantly lowering the frequency of water shortages.
* **Accurate Demand Prediction**: Built a robust time series model to analyze past patterns and forecast future water demand.
* **Cost Optimization**: Supplemented forecasts with cost comparisons across multiple water sources, aiding financial planning.
